Topics to Get Better At:
- have a healthcheck endpoint? Spring Boot Actuator?
- Code Structure ******
- Maven - Run configurations like spring-boot:run
- Managing environments (dev, qa, prod)
- Spring concepts
- Spring REST API
- Async calls + chaining
- Unit testing : JUnit/ Mockito / Integration testing
- Managing secrets with AWS Secrets Manager
- Software architecture/ design patterns
- Best coding practices
- Organizing my Postman stuff
- Token Handling
- Linting


Questions:
- do you use a checklist of things to do when you have to re-do your IDE setup? like a new laptop?
- important backend tasks that I should practice?
- is it standard to use Spring Boot?
- additional tools you use like how we used mscgen for sequence diagrams?
- convention for naming packages?
- convention for naming/separating features?
- DTO and DAO?
- deploy into cluster? serverless or containers?
- ensuring RESTful?
- determining what code is into the backend vs middle?
- Kotlin with Spring? 
- where do you see/check the logging for Slf4j?
- things to make sure NEVER to have in your repo (like credentials or .iml files)

Annotation Sources
1. Lombok Ref (declarations + annotations):
- https://projectlombok.org/features/all
- https://projectlombok.org/api/
- Slf4j

2. Java Built-In Annotations:
(java.lang)
(java.lang.annotation)
- https://jaxenter.com/understand-annotations-java-148001.html

3. Custom Annotations: (Recommended?)
- x

4. JPA Annotations
Use:
- @Table
- @Column
- @Id

5. Jackson Annotations

6. JAX-RS Annotations

Spring Boot Dev Tools
Spring Boot Actuator - check application health

Considerations:
- Project Scaling
- Handling Heavy Load
